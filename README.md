Voici une proposition de lettre de motivation en français, adaptée à ton profil et à l’offre de stage :

Objet : Candidature au stage de programmeur Unity – Montpellier

Madame, Monsieur,

Actuellement étudiant en quatrième année à la Game Academy d’Avignon dans le cursus de programmation jeu vidéo, je souhaite vous proposer ma candidature pour le stage de six mois en développement Unity et C#. Ce stage représente pour moi l’opportunité idéale de mettre en pratique mes compétences techniques et de contribuer à vos projets tout en perfectionnant mon savoir-faire.

Au cours de mes études, j’ai réalisé plusieurs projets en Unity mêlant gameplay et interfaces utilisateur. J’ai notamment développé un jeu d’horreur avec une IA réagissant à la vue et au bruit du joueur, intégrant également des mécaniques de puzzles et un système d’audio spatialisé. Ces expériences m’ont permis de renforcer ma maîtrise du langage C#, de concevoir et d’implémenter des mécaniques de jeu variées, ainsi que de travailler sur des interfaces immersives.

Par ailleurs, mes projets en C++ et en Unreal Engine m’ont habitué à lire, analyser et intégrer du code existant, mais aussi à collaborer avec d’autres développeurs via Git et GitHub. Cette pratique régulière des outils de versioning me permet de travailler efficacement en équipe et de maintenir une bonne qualité de code. J’ai également un fort intérêt pour les questions d’architecture logicielle, que je cherche à approfondir afin d’améliorer la structure et la durabilité de mes projets.

Motivé, rigoureux et passionné par le développement de jeux vidéo, je serais honoré de pouvoir rejoindre votre équipe à Montpellier pour contribuer à vos productions actuelles et futures.

Je vous remercie pour l’attention portée à ma candidature et reste à votre disposition pour un entretien. Vous trouverez ci-joint mon CV ainsi qu’un lien vers mon portfolio et mon GitHub.

Veuillez agréer, Madame, Monsieur, l’expression de mes salutations distinguées.

Veux-tu que je te fasse une version plus courte et percutante, ou bien garder ce style classique et détaillé ?

You said:
what ? Actuellement étudiant en quatrième année ??
ChatGPT said:

Ah right — you’ve already finished your 4th year at Game Academy (not “currently in”). Let me fix that line so it matches your situation. Here’s a corrected version:

Want me to make it shorter and punchier (since some recruiters prefer 1-page quick reads), or keep this longer, detailed style?

You said:
lets do this
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that’s the classic GitHub profile README “About Me” template with emojis.
We can fill it out with content tailored to your background (Unity, Unreal, AI, gameplay programming). Here’s a draft for you:

About Me :

🛠️ I’m currently working on:
Developing gameplay systems and AI for 3D action/adventure prototypes in Unreal Engine and Unity.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
Game projects that focus on AI-driven mechanics, combat systems, or immersive player experiences.

🧠 I’m looking for help with:
Optimizing AI decision-making and multiplayer gameplay features.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
Advanced game AI techniques (Behavior Trees, EQS, Genetic Algorithms) and improving software architecture patterns in C++ and C#.

💬 Ask me about:
Gameplay programming, AI behavior systems, or how to structure projects in Unreal Engine and Unity.

⚡ Fun fact:
I once built a horror game where the AI reacts dynamically to sound and sight, leading to some pretty intense jump scares!

Do you want me to make it sound more professional and recruiter-friendly, or casual and fun (like for other devs checking your GitHub)?

You said:
not bad except the fun fact i guess, its really just a side project and shouldnt be glazed
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — no need to oversell the horror game as a "fun fact."
Here are a few better options for the ⚡Fun fact section that stay light but still show personality without overselling side projects:

⚡ Fun fact: I started programming because I wanted to make my own games.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy reverse-engineering game mechanics when I play.

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve used both C++ and C# for game development, but I still can’t decide which one I like more.

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve worked on projects ranging from simple 2D prototypes to complex 3D AI systems.

👉 Do you want the “fun fact” to be more personal/human (like a hobby or quirky trait) or more dev-focused (something about your skills or tools)?

You said:
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy reverse-engineering game mechanics when I play. not bad but isnt really true
ChatGPT said:

Fair point — let’s make one that feels authentic and still works well in a GitHub “About Me.”

Here are a few alternatives you might like:

⚡ Fun fact: I usually learn new engines by building small prototypes first.

⚡ Fun fact: I tend to spot bugs in games faster than my friends.

⚡ Fun fact: I like breaking down how AI opponents behave in different genres.

⚡ Fun fact: My projects often start as simple ideas but grow into full gameplay systems.

Do you want the fun fact to lean more personal/quirky (like hobbies outside coding) or stay game-dev focused?

You said:
Fun fact: I like breaking down how AI opponents behave in different genres. this is true, is it a fun fact tho
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, you’re right — that one reads more like a professional statement than a quirky “fun fact.” It’s good, but it doesn’t quite hit the fun vibe.

If you want to keep it truthful but lighter, here are some reworks of your idea:

⚡ Fun fact: I can’t play a game without secretly analyzing the enemy AI.

⚡ Fun fact: Sometimes I spend more time studying AI behavior than actually finishing the game.

⚡ Fun fact: Playing games often turns into a mini research session on how the AI works.

👉 Would you like me to polish it so it sounds playful but still professional, or do you want it more casual and gamer-like?

You said:
 anything i woulkd know here?
ChatGPT said:

Looking at this screenshot, it’s basically a giant tech stack tag cloud (frameworks, libraries, hosting, servers, etc.).
Given your background (Unity, Unreal Engine, C++, C#, AI/gameplay systems), here are the ones you’d likely know or at least have touched concepts related to:

🎮 Relevant to your field

OpenGL / WebGL / WebGPU → Low-level graphics APIs. You’ve worked with rendering in SFML and Unreal/Unity, so concepts overlap.

Three.js → JavaScript 3D library built on WebGL. Similar rendering principles to Unity/Unreal, but in the browser.

Raylib → Lightweight C library for 2D/3D games. Closer to your C++ SFML work.

Qt → C++ framework for GUI apps. You might not have used it, but syntax and build setup feels familiar if you’ve done C++ UI tools.

🧑‍💻 General Programming / Crossovers

Django / Flask / FastAPI → Python frameworks. You used Python (NumPy, neural net stuff), so these would feel approachable.

CUDA / OpenCV → CUDA = GPU programming (ties into AI acceleration), OpenCV = computer vision. Both are relevant if you push further into AI research.

ROS → Robotics framework. If you ever dive into AI agents/robotics, this becomes relevant.

🌐 Tools / Workflow

GitHub / Git (not shown but implied) → You already use Git for version control.

Docker / Kubernetes (not visible but often around here) → Not strictly in your wheelhouse yet, but useful if you go deeper into scalable AI systems.

Less relevant for you (for now)

React / Angular / Vue / Svelte → All frontend web dev frameworks. Not tied to your core game dev work.

Laravel, Symfony, Rails → Web backends (PHP, Ruby).

Joomla, Drupal, WordPress → CMS tools, mostly web.

Chart.js, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap → UI libraries for web.

👉 In short:

Directly relevant: OpenGL, WebGL, Three.js, Raylib, Qt, CUDA, OpenCV

Somewhat relevant: Flask/FastAPI/Django (Python AI/web tools)

Mostly web stuff → not your focus.

Do you want me to make you a filtered “stack list” (just the tags from here that fit your CV / GitHub README) so you can show them off without noise?

You said:
nothing in hosting/saas
ChatGPT said:

Exactly 👍 — nothing in Hosting / SaaS (top row of your screenshot) really overlaps with your experience or what you’d normally showcase as a gameplay / AI programmer.

That whole section is things like:

AWS, Azure, Google Cloud → cloud hosting providers.

Firebase, Netlify, Vercel, Render → backend & web hosting.

DigitalOcean, OVH, Scaleway, Linode → VPS providers.

They’re super relevant if you were doing web apps, backend services, or scalable online systems, but in your case (Unity, Unreal, SFML, AI/game systems) you don’t need them on your profile.

👉 Unless you specifically built:

An online multiplayer backend (with cloud servers).

Or hosted an AI/web service in the cloud.

…you can skip this section without worry.

Do you want me to help you trim that giant list into a “relevant tech stack” that actually strengthens your GitHub/portfolio, instead of drowning recruiters in unrelated web tech?

You said:
never did javascript tho
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — then you can confidently ignore 80% of that big “frameworks & libraries” cloud since most of it is JavaScript land (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.).

For your profile, I’d keep it lean and only list things you’ve actually worked with or that connect directly to game dev / AI. Based on what you’ve told me and your past projects:

✅ Relevant to You

C++ / C# (core languages)

Unity / Unreal Engine (main engines)

SFML (C++ graphics/game framework you used)

OpenGL (conceptual overlap with SFML/graphics)

Raylib (close to SFML, optional mention)

Qt (if you’ve touched GUI tooling in C++)

CUDA / OpenCV (since you worked on AI + NumPy/neural net stuff, this is a possible future-relevant mention)

❌ Skip (for now)

All JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Three.js, etc.) since you’ve never done JS.

Web dev backends (Django, Flask, Rails, Laravel, etc.) — unless you had side projects.

Hosting/SaaS (AWS, Firebase, Vercel, etc.) — unless you built multiplayer or backend services.

👉 So your GitHub “Tech Stack” section should really just highlight Game + AI + C++/C# tools, not random web frameworks.

Do you want me to draft a clean “Tech Stack” block (like those badge styles you see on GitHub READMEs) with only the tools that fit your profile?

You said:
here ?
ChatGPT said:

Nice, this part of the stack cloud covers Servers, Databases, Design tools, and Machine Learning/Deep Learning.
Here’s what’s relevant to you given your background (C++, Unity, Unreal, AI, NumPy, PyTorch, SFML, game dev tools):

✅ Relevant for You

ML/DL (Machine Learning / Deep Learning)

NumPy → you’ve used this in your neural network project.

Pandas → often goes with NumPy (data manipulation).

Matplotlib / Plotly → visualization, maybe light use if you did graphs.

PyTorch → if you worked on your number recognition / neural net project.

Scikit-learn / SciPy → ML / scientific computing, ties to AI learning.

TensorFlow → only if you experimented with it, otherwise skip.

Design

Blender → relevant if you’ve ever done simple 3D modeling/animations (common in game dev projects).

Photoshop / GIMP → if you touched textures/UI assets.

Krita / Aseprite → pixel art or texture work (only if you’ve used).

❌ Less Relevant (Skip unless you’ve used)

Databases/ORM (MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.) → Not needed unless you did multiplayer or backend systems.

Servers (Apache, Tomcat, Jenkins, Nginx, etc.) → Mostly for web/backend dev, not for your game AI work.

Adobe Suite (Illustrator, InDesign, XD, Premiere Pro) → These are more for graphic design/video editing, not programming.

👉 For your GitHub Tech Stack / CV, the strongest picks here are:

NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for AI/ML credibility)

Blender, Photoshop/GIMP (if you did asset editing in your projects)

Want me to build a clean “Tech Stack” badge section (like those little shields/badges for GitHub READMEs) with just the relevant ones from all the screenshots we’ve gone through? That way you’d have a plug-and-play block for your profile.

You said:
now this is great how can i do this ? 
ChatGPT said:

Nice — what you’re seeing there is a GitHub README with badges and a timeline layout. It’s all done in Markdown (plus shields.io badges for the tech labels).

Here’s how you can make something like that for your own profile:

1. Create / Edit Your GitHub Profile README

Go to GitHub
.

Make a repo with the same name as your username (e.g., AlanSordelet/AlanSordelet).

Inside, create a README.md.

Whatever you write there will appear on your GitHub profile page.

2. Structure Your Timeline

Use Markdown headers and italics for style:

## 📅 Projects & Contributions Timeline

### 2025 — ImEngine (Personal Project) • 🛠️
*Custom modular game engine with Vulkan renderer and ImGui editor.*

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-17%2F20-blue) 
![Vulkan](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vulkan-API-red) 
![ImGui](https://img.shields.io/badge/ImGui-Docking-orange)

- In Progress  
[Repository →](https://github.com/your-repo-link)

---

### 2025 — Wild-31 (School Project) • 🎮
*Beat down, crush, and take down the mobsters and the Big Boss who silence and oppress the people, to liberate the city.*

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-17%2F20-blue) 
![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unreal%20Engine-5-black) 
![Wwise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Wwise-Sound-orange)

- Designed the game code architecture (entities, class hierarchy, etc.)  
- Tooling (animation collider management, editor helper to bind input actions to callbacks)  
- Big Boss AI (Behavior Trees, Tasks, Animations, etc.)  

[Repository →](https://github.com/your-repo-link)

---

### 2024 — Crush Cars (School Project) • 🎮
*Dive into watercolor arenas where karting becomes a combat sport! Dash, charge, and eliminate your opponents using a crazy arsenal of items, all set in a unique atmosphere inspired by the wild 1930s cartoons.*

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-Unity-purple) 
![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-5-green)

[Repository →](https://github.com/your-repo-link)

3. Use Shields.io Badges

Site: https://shields.io/

Example:

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-17%2F20-blue)

![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-5-green)

You can customize text, colors, and logos.

4. Style Tricks

Use --- for separators.

Use italics for project subtitles.

Emojis (🎮, 🛠️, 📅) add personality.

👉 Do you want me to make you a ready-to-paste README template with your projects (ImEngine, Wild-31, Crush Cars, MNIST, Horror Game) already filled in? That way you’d just swap repo links and it’s done.

You said:
ok well there is also this that is cool much better than mine no? second pic is mine 
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, I see what you mean 👀

First profile (Mattias FUSTER’s) → Clean, professional, structured. Uses:

A short headline (“Game Engine Developer – Real-Time 3D Rendering…”)

Simple but effective badges (C++, Vulkan, UE5, etc.)

Sections: About Me, Current Project, Tech Stack.

Minimal, no clutter, reads like a polished CV.

Yours (second pic) → Strong content, but it feels busier and less focused because:

You’ve got a lot of social badges (Facebook, TikTok, etc.), which makes it look more casual. Recruiters might see it as distracting.

Your Tech Stack has some tools you haven’t really used deeply (Django, Firebase, Adobe Audition, TensorFlow). That weakens credibility.

The “About Me” section is good, but formatting is heavier — long sentences, fewer highlights.

🔧 How to make yours more like his (while keeping your personality):

Headline at the top:
Instead of just "About Me," start with a bold intro like:

Hi there 👋 I'm Alan Sordelet
🎮 Gameplay & AI Programmer · C++ · Unreal Engine 5 · Unity · Game AI


→ instantly sets the tone.

Trim socials: Keep LinkedIn, GitHub, Portfolio, Email (drop TikTok/FB — they feel unprofessional here).

Refine Tech Stack: Only list what you’ve actually worked with in projects:

C++, C#, Python

Unity, Unreal Engine 5, SFML

NumPy, PyTorch, Pandas, Matplotlib (AI work)

OpenGL (through SFML / graphics concepts)

Git, GitHub, CMake

Blender/Photoshop (if you used them for assets)

→ Drop Django, Firebase, TensorFlow, Audition, etc. (they make it look inflated).

Break “About Me” into bullets like his:

🎯 Focus: Gameplay programming, AI systems, combat mechanics
🔬 Interests: Behavior Trees, EQS, Genetic Algorithms
🛠️ Currently working on: AI-driven prototypes in Unreal & Unity
🚀 Always learning better architecture and clean code


Add “Current Project” section like his → feature ImEngine and maybe Wild-31 as highlights.

👉 If you want, I can rewrite your README in Mattias’ cleaner style, but tailored to you (with your AI + gameplay angle, not engine dev). Would you like me to draft that version?

You said:
his is centered though and has lines cutting acrross 
ChatGPT said:

Exactly — you caught two key style details from his profile:

Centered text & badges
→ Done in Markdown by wrapping content in <div align="center"> ... </div> or using HTML <p align="center">.
Example:

<div align="center">

# Hi there 👋 I'm Alan Sordelet  
🎮 Gameplay & AI Programmer · C++ · Unreal Engine 5 · Unity · Game AI  

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-17%2F20-blue) 
![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unreal%20Engine-5-black) 
![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-2022-green)  

</div>


Horizontal lines cutting across sections
→ Simply Markdown --- or ___.
Example:

---

## 🎯 About Me  
- Focus: Gameplay programming, AI systems, combat mechanics  
- Interests: Behavior Trees, EQS, Genetic Algorithms  
- Currently working on AI-driven prototypes in Unreal & Unity  
- Always learning better architecture and clean code  

---


That’s why his looks so structured — center for the intro, then horizontal rules separating sections.

⚡ If you want, I can take your current README and refactor it to match Mattias’ style:

Centered intro with badges

Clean bullet-point About Me

A Current Project section

A Tech Stack table

👉 Want me to build that full cleaned-up version for you, ready to paste into your README.md?

You said:
now put the new unity and python and openghl sfml
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 Let’s rebuild your README in the clean, centered style like Mattias’, but with your actual tools: Unity (new), Python, OpenGL, SFML, Unreal Engine 5, C++, C#.

Here’s a polished version you can paste into your README.md:

<div align="center">
